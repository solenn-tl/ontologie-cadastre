         Record Set may physically reside together, though physical proximity is not essential. In a
         particular context, an Agent (for example, administrator, records manager, archivist,
         end-user, etc.) may select the member records of a Record Set based on any shared attribute
         or attributes, or any shared relation or relations. The grouping of the records serves a
         purpose or purposes specific to the context of the Agent. For example, all member records
         of a Record Set have been accumulated by the same Agent; have the same Documentary Form
         Type; or are related to and document the same Activity. A Record Set may represent the act
         of classifying the records in accordance with a formal classification scheme that may be
         based on activity, subject, organizational structure, or other criteria; an act of archival
         arrangement (for example, based on common provenance); or some other selection and grouping
         that fulfils a particular purpose or purposes (for example, a classification that reflects
         or supports the purposes of a researcher). By exception, some records are brought together
         based on their not belonging in the context of selection to other designated groups: a
         'Miscellaneous' series, for example. A Record Sset accumulated by an Agent in the course of
         life or work activity should be described in a manner that preserves context and evidential
         value. Record Sets may also contain other Record Sets. A Record Set or Record may
         simultaneously be a member of more than one Record Set, and over the course of its
         existence, a Record Set or Record may be a member of an indeterminate number of Record Sets
         in an indeterminate number of contexts. Record Sets and Records contained within a Record
         Set may be ordered into a sequence based on a common property or relation, or common
         properties or relations (for example, alphabetical by agent or related place);
         chronological order by creation date; or some other criterion (for example, an imposed

  skos:scopeNote """A Record or Record Part must have been instantiated at least
         once, though this instantiation may no longer exist at the moment of description. An
         instantiation might also exist at the moment of description, but be destroyed at a later
         moment in time, when, for example, a derived instantiation might become the only remaining
         instantiation. A Record Set may have an instantiation, which is to say that it is not a
         necessary condition. An Instantiation may be derived from another Instantiation. A Record
         Resource may have many Instantiations simultaneously (for instance, a record printed and
         saved in the same time as DOCX and PDF/A would have 3 concurrent instantiations) or through
         time (for example, copy of a record). Depending on the context, a new instantiation may be
         seen as a new or as the same record resource. During in the process of re-instantiation
         something is lost and something is preserved, but it is up to the context and the Agent
         that produces or uses that Instantiation to assess whether the two instantiations are
         functionally equivalent or not. For instance, a postcard representing a town map from 1874
         (Instantiation 1) is digitized and kept as a JPEG file (Instantiation 2). The digital copy
         may be considered as instantiating the "same" Record by an Agent considering the
         information transmitted by the Record (e.g., the urban landscape displayed), but as a"
         different" Record by an antiquarian more focused on the materiality of the carrier.
         Successive instantiations may change the perceivable boundaries of a Record Resource. For
         instance, a case file comprising many records may be digitized and saved as one single PDF
         file, which, from management perspective, may be treated as one Record. Similarly, a large
         Record Set (a fonds or a series) may be maintained as one database. On the other hand, one
         record (main document and its annexes) may be digitized in separate files and each one may
         be managed as a discrete “physical” item. Instantiations may require mediation to
         communicate the information in the Record Resource. While a traditional Record on paper can
         simply be read by an Agent in order to understand the information, a vinyl recording, a
         video cassette or a digital file needs a device (mediator) to codify or decodify the
         information conveyed. This mediator may imply simple physical components (a turntable
         needle, for example), or a complex gallery of software and hardware elements.
         Instantiations are more than the mere informational content of Record Resource and may be
         the focus of preservation and physical management of records. The use of particular
         document types for records, such as a medieval charter, may have implications for the
         authenticity of the records. Hence, the way a Record Resource is instantiated contributes
         to the contextualizing of the content.record resource is instantiated contributes to the
         contextualizing the content. Distinguishing the message conveyed (Record Resource) and its
         physical representations (Instantiation) allows for the efficient management of their
         descriptions, and preserve information about a Record Resource even when no physical
         representation of it exists or is known to exist anymore. The relations between distinct
         instantiations can then be expressed wherever they coexist, and they can be related to the
         Record Resource they instantiate."""@en ;
